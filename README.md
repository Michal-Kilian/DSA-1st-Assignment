# DSA-1st-Assignment

This project is the first assignment for the course Data Structures & Algorithms. The point of this assignment was to create a Hash table using 2 different types of data structures. This project was created entirely in Java programming language. There are 2 types of hashing included, linear hashing and chaining hashing. 

Linear hashing is a dynamic data structure which implements a hash table and grows or shrinks one bucket at a time.
Chaining hashing is a dynamic data structure that implements a technique in which once a collision occurs, the value is chained to a linked list at the place of a targeted key.

This project was completed on 23.3.2022.
